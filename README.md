# utility-scripts
Loose collection of system and file management scripts written in multiple languages.
The idea behind this repo is to enable quick transfer of scripts written as part of automation efforts.
None of these are good, and all of these are specific to my use case. Keeping this public for ease of access.
If you find any of this useful or helpful, my cockles are warmed.
